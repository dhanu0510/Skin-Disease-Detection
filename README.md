### 🌟Execute Process: 
  
  1. install requiremets.txt file first,
  * If you want to download the data and train the Model from begin then start here else start from step 5
  2. Download the data and from given link and Extract all images to single 'input' name folder
  3. run 'train_data_making.ipynb'
  4. run 'training.ipynb' 
        * For model training we have Created Convolution newural network using Keras and Tensorflow
  5. then run main.py (python main.py)
  6. open http://localhost:12000/
